# asdia.sty
A LaTeX style file for homework and assignments. It is inspired by Pascal Michaillatâ€™s [latex-math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) and Evan Chen's [evan.sty](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty).

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://asdia.dev/projects/stydoc.pdf).

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have $\TeX$ on your local machine.
2. Locate your $\LaTeX$ package directory. This is typically located in the `tex/latex/` folder of your $\TeX$ distribution. For more guidance, refer to [step 3 of this guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages#Installing_a_package).
4. Within the package directory, create a new folder called `asdia`.
5. Download [`asdia.sty`](asdia.sty) and place it in the newly created `asdia` folder.
6. Update the package index for your $\TeX$ distribution. This process varies by distribution. For detailed instructions, see [step 4 of this guide](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages#Installing_a_package).
7. Done!
